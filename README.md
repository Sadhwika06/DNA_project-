# Fashion Apparel Classification using CNN

This project focuses on classifying different types of fashion apparel (such as shirts, trousers, shoes, and more) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages deep learning to automatically extract features and improve classification accuracy.

# Technologies
- Python 
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

Project Goals

- To build and train a CNN model for fashion apparel image classification.
- To evaluate the model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
- To visualize training progress with plots.
- To provide a baseline for future improvements in fashion recognition systems.
